# Cognitive Load Theory in UX Design

Cognitive load theory suggests that human working memory has limited capacity for processing information. This has significant implications for user interface design:

## Key Principles
- **Intrinsic Load**: Complexity inherent to the task
- **Extraneous Load**: Poor design that adds unnecessary complexity  
- **Germane Load**: Processing that helps learning and understanding

User: "Find connections between my design notes and psychology research"

Claude: I found several interesting connections in your knowledge base:

• "Cognitive Load Theory" connects to "Minimalist Design Principles"
• "Color Psychology in Interfaces" relates to "User Attention Patterns" 
• "Decision Fatigue" from your psychology notes explains why "Progressive Disclosure" works in UX

Would you like me to create a synthesis note exploring these connections?
