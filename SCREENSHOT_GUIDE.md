# Cognitive Load Theory in UX Design

Cognitive load theory suggests that human working memory has limited capacity for processing information. This has significant implications for user interface design:

## Key Principles
- **Intrinsic Load**: Complexity inherent to the task
- **Extraneous Load**: Poor design that adds unnecessary complexity  
- **Germane Load**: Processing that helps learning and understanding
