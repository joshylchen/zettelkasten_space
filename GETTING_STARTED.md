## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **MCP Connection Problems**
```bash
# Check if Claude can see your server
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Start new conversation  
3. Look for "Zettelkasten Space" in available tools
4. If missing, restart Claude Desktop
5. Verify token hasn't expired (regenerate if needed)
```

### **Note Creation Issues**
- ❌ **Can't create notes**: Check your internet connection
- ❌ **Missing connections**: Use exact note titles in `[[links]]`
- ❌ **Tags not working**: Ensure tags start with `#` and contain no spaces

### **Search Not Finding Notes**
- 🔍 **Try different keywords**: Use synonyms or related terms
- 📅 **Check date ranges**: Notes might be filtered by time
- 🏷️ **Verify tags**: Ensure correct tag format and spelling

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Success**

### **1. Start Small, Scale Up**
- Begin with 5-10 quality notes rather than dozens of quick captures
- Focus on one knowledge area first, then expand
- Let connections emerge naturally rather than forcing them

### **2. Use AI as Your Knowledge Partner**
- Ask Claude to help you structure messy thoughts
- Request summaries when you have too many notes on a topic
- Use AI to find patterns you might miss

### **3. Develop Your Unique System**
- Create consistent tagging conventions
- Establish note templates for different purposes
- Build regular review rhythms that work for your schedule

### **4. Leverage Network Effects**
- Connect new learning to existing knowledge
- Create "hub" notes that link to related concepts
- Use AI to suggest unexpected connections
